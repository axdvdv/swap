## How it works



BTC -> ETH

Alice wants to sell BTC and buy ETH, Bob owerthise wants to sell ETH and buy ETH.

* [x] 1. Alice creates order 1 BTC -> 10 ETH
* [x]2. Bob pushes a 'Buy' button in the orders list and is redirected to /eth-to-btc/:id page.
* [x]3. Alice is notified about Bob and is redirected to /btc-to-eth/:id page.
* [x]4. Alice is asked to create a 'Secret Key'. 
* [ ]5. The system automatically generates the 'Secret Hash', shows it to Alice and sends to Bob.
* [ ]6. The system automatically calls the ETH Swap contract method to create a swap. 
* [ ]7. The system asks Bob to sign the transaction (Bob fund the ETH Swap contract here).
* [x]8. The system automatically creates a BTC Swap script.
* [x]9. Alice is notified that Bob fund the ETH Swap contract. The system asks Alice to fund the script (Alice fund the script here).
* [x]10. Bob is notified that Alice fund the script.
* [ ]11. The system automatically sends the ETH Swap contract address to Alice and the script to Bob.
* [ ]12. Alice signs a call to the ETH Swap contract to withdraw ETH.
